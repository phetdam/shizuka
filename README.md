Giving you peace of mind by simplifying the analysis of statistical model performance. Work in progress.

If I think this package is good enough for public use, I might put it up on PyPI. Stay tuned.

## Modules

* `plotting`: Module containing plotting methods wrapping `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to simplify model analysis.

* `model_selection`: Module containing methods for more specialized model selection methods. Intended as a complement to a more complete machine learning package such as `sklearn`.
